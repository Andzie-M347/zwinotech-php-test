- Total number of items in each categories
- Total items that are prioritised by High, Low, medium and no priority
- Total hours, then broken down by category, MVP and priority
- Total items that are MVP and their respective category

The data from the spreadsheet should be stored in a DB (MySQL preferred).

You are allowed to use any framework at your disposal.

Ensure that your data is presentable.

> Once completed, share your git repo(s) where youâ€™ve uploaded your source code.

### Extra Points:

- The following is not required for the test, but doing the following will demonstrate your ability:
- Sending an email with the generated report
- Generate a downloadable PDF from the dataset
